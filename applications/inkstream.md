## Project Overview \:page\_facing\_up:

### Overview

* **Tagline:** *Programmable token streaming and payments for Polkadot’s Web3 ecosystem.*
* **Description:** InkStream is an on-chain token streaming protocol that enables users to continuously send and split funds to multiple recipients on Polkadot. Similar to **Drips.network** on Ethereum, our product allows flexible, programmable cash flows: users can configure streams of DOT or other assets to one or many recipients with customizable allocation (percentage splits or fixed amounts per recipient). Funds accumulate and distribute on-chain at predefined intervals (e.g. monthly), automating recurring payments like subscriptions, salaries, or funding open-source projects. InkStream will provide a user-friendly dashboard and developer API for managing streams, all built with the ink! smart contract framework.
* **Relation to ink! Ecosystem:** This project is being built natively in ink! 6.x on a Substrate chain (Polkadot AssetHub), showcasing ink!’s capabilities for complex financial logic. It serves as **infrastructure** for other dApps: any ink!-based project or Substrate parachain can integrate InkStream’s contracts or use its SDK to add token streaming features. By leveraging Polkadot’s multi-chain environment (through XCM), InkStream will uniquely allow streaming assets across different Substrate chains, highlighting an advantage of ink!/Substrate over EVM-based solutions.
* **Project Category:** *Infrastructure.* InkStream addresses a critical infrastructure need in Polkadot’s smart contract ecosystem – a flexible payment streaming mechanism. This was a specific Request for Proposal (RFP) item, underscoring its importance. As **infrastructure**, InkStream will be a general-purpose protocol that many teams and communities can use (from funding open-source dependencies to DAO treasury distributions). It fills a gap not currently served in ink!: while Ethereum has streaming protocols (e.g. Sablier, Superfluid, Drips), Polkadot lacks an equivalent. InkStream’s innovation and native integration will strengthen the appeal of ink! by providing out-of-the-box support for continuous funding flows, a feature attractive to Web3 businesses and community projects alike.
* **Motivation:** Our team at Chainscore Labs is passionate about advancing Web3 financial primitives on Polkadot. We are interested in creating InkStream because we see a need for ongoing funding tools in the ecosystem – for example, to let project teams sustain open-source development via continuous contributions, or to enable DAOs to stream treasury funds with transparency. By building InkStream, we not only tackle a real problem (inefficient manual payments) but also demonstrate ink!’s power in handling complex logic (like split payments) in a secure, scalable way. We are inspired by Drips.network’s success in funding open-source on Ethereum and want to bring and extend that model in the Polkadot ecosystem. Chainscore Labs is committed to maintaining this project long-term as a core piece of Polkadot’s open infrastructure.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

InkStream will **benefit the ink! ecosystem** by introducing a novel, highly useful capability – automated token streaming with programmable splits – that currently does not exist natively on Polkadot. This unlocks several important use cases:

* **Funding Open-Source and Public Goods:** Much like Drips allows funding GitHub projects via dependency graphs, InkStream will enable Polkadot builders to continuously fund the projects and developers they rely on. This encourages a culture of sustainable funding in Polkadot’s developer community. Our protocol integrates with GitHub identities, so contributors can claim funding for their repositories, creating a decentralized grant mechanism in the ink! space.

* **Subscription Payments and Salaries:** Web3 projects on Polkadot can use InkStream to pay contributors, validators, or service providers in a streaming fashion (e.g. streaming DOT or stablecoins every block). This demonstrates ink!’s strength in **financial contract logic**. Notably, doing this on Polkadot can be cheaper and more flexible than on Ethereum due to lower fees and built-in multi-asset support, showcasing an **advantage of ink!** over Solidity for recurring payments.

* **Treasury and DAO Distributions:** Polkadot’s on-chain treasuries and DAO collectives could integrate InkStream to disburse funds gradually, improving transparency and accountability. For example, a treasury can stream allocations to projects milestone-by-milestone instead of one lump sum. This promotes Polkadot’s governance values and demonstrates how ink! smart contracts can enhance on-chain governance processes.

* **Cross-Chain Asset Streaming:** Because InkStream will leverage Substrate’s XCM capabilities, users will be able to route funds to **external Substrate addresses** (e.g. a user on another parachain). This is a unique innovation not seen in EVM-based streaming solutions. It highlights Polkadot’s **multi-chain interoperability**: an ink! contract on AssetHub can send assets to an account on, say, Moonbeam or Acala seamlessly. This capability will attract projects that operate across chains, solidifying Polkadot’s position as a **cross-chain hub for DeFi and payments**.

By delivering these functionalities, InkStream contributes to the **growth of Web3, Polkadot, and ink!** in several ways. It provides a reference implementation of a complex, real-world financial dApp in ink!, encouraging other developers to build on ink! for advanced use cases (instead of defaulting to EVM). It also **showcases the advantage of ink!** by potentially achieving lower resource usage and higher security for streaming logic compared to EVM equivalents (thanks to Rust’s safety and Wasm performance optimizations). Finally, as an open-source infrastructure project, InkStream will be a building block that other Polkadot ecosystem projects (wallets, UIs, DeFi protocols) can incorporate, thereby increasing ink!’s visibility and demonstrating that Polkadot’s contract ecosystem is maturing with rich functionalities.

If successful and widely adopted, InkStream could become a **flagship ink! dApp**, driving more activity to Polkadot’s contract parachains and inspiring further innovation. We will actively promote InkStream’s usage, write about our experience developing in ink!, and collaborate with the community (for example, via the Polkadot Forum and technical workshops). In summary, **InkStream advances Polkadot’s smart contract ecosystem by introducing a critical piece of financial infrastructure** that reinforces the network’s position as a leading platform for innovative Web3 solutions.

### Project Details

**Core Functionality & Data Model:**
InkStream’s core is an ink! smart contract (or set of contracts) implementing **on-chain programmable token streams with split payments**. The primary data model revolves around *“Stream Lists”* (analogous to Drips’ Drip Lists). A Stream List is a configuration created by a user (stream sender) that defines how to distribute incoming funds to multiple recipients. Key parameters and structures include:

* **Recipients Configuration:** Each Stream List can have up to N recipients (we plan for a high limit like 100-200 recipients per list, similar to Drips’ 200 limit). For each recipient, the stream creator can specify either a percentage of the total stream or a fixed rate/amount. We will support both modes:

  * *Percentage-based:* e.g. Recipient A gets 50% of the stream, B gets 30%, C gets 20%. This is useful when splitting a variable amount.
  * *Fixed amount:* e.g. 5 DOT per month to A, 10 DOT per month to B, remainder to C. Fixed allocations are useful for predictable payouts. The contract will enforce that the sum of fixed portions does not exceed the total stream budget.

* **Stream Rate and Duration:** A user can start a stream by depositing funds into the contract and specifying a rate (amount per second, per block, or per month). For example, a user might deposit 120 DOT and set a stream of 10 DOT per month for 12 months. The contract holds the funds in escrow and **drips** them over time to the recipients. We will use block timestamps or block count to calculate the accrued amount for each recipient. The distribution interval can be configured (default monthly cycle to match Drips’ model, but possibly adjustable).

* **Accumulation & Distribution:** As time progresses, funds for each recipient accumulate within the contract. At the end of each interval (or upon manual trigger), the contract executes the distribution: transferring the accumulated amounts to each recipient address. This design ensures efficiency by batching transfers (e.g., monthly) rather than every block. The contract will have a function like `distribute(stream_id)` that anyone (or an off-chain scheduler) can call to perform the payout for that stream. We will implement safeguards to prevent gas/weight overload (e.g., limit distribution per call to a subset of recipients if N is large, using iterative calls if needed).

* **Identity & Recipient Types:** Recipients can be standard Polkadot **AccountId32** addresses or special identity references:

  * We will integrate with Polkadot’s on-chain identity system: if a recipient address has a registered identity, our UI will display their name/handle (e.g. display, Twitter handle, etc.) pulled from the chain’s identity pallet via RPC.
  * **GitHub Handles:** For open-source funding, we will allow recipients to be identified by a GitHub repository or username. Technically, this will be handled via an off-chain mapping: e.g., a “repository ID” can be mapped to a Polkadot address controlled by that project’s maintainers. We plan to implement a *claim mechanism* where an open-source maintainer can call an `claim(repo_url, proof)` function on our contract to link their Polkadot address to a GitHub repo name. The proof could be a signed GitHub gist or OAuth verification through our front-end that then calls the contract. Once claimed, the repo (as an identifier) becomes a valid recipient in Stream Lists, and funds sent to that repo are claimable by the maintainers (with automatic splits to their contributors if configured). This mirrors Drips’ model of funding GitHub repos and their dependency graph.
  * **ENS-like Names:** If a user has an ENS or other Web3 name linked to their Polkadot address (for instance via a registrar or KILT’s web3name), our platform will resolve and display those names in the UI. While we will not implement a new naming service from scratch, we’ll remain compatible with any name service pallet active on AssetHub or the relay chain. We consider integrating **Polkadot Name System** if available in the future, so that users can send streams to a human-readable name which our backend/contract resolves to an address.

* **Global Splitting Graph:** A powerful feature we plan is enabling **nested stream lists** (a recipient of one stream can itself be another Stream List). For example, user X streams to Project Y (a repo), which automatically forwards a percentage to its dependency Z. We will implement this by allowing a Stream List to be designated as a “project” with both maintainers and dependencies (just like Drips’ Projects). In contract terms, a recipient could be a struct referencing another stream config. During distribution, the contract will recursively traverse such links: first allocate to Project Y, then immediately split Y’s share among Y’s defined recipients (maintainers/dependencies). To manage complexity, we will enforce a directed acyclic graph (no circular splits) and possibly a depth limit, and handle distribution via breadth-first traversal of the graph. This “dependency tree” approach ensures even deeply nested dependencies get their share of funding. Implementing this on-chain in ink! is challenging but feasible with careful optimization (e.g., caching split fractions to minimize recalculation). This feature will **extend drips.network’s functionality**, making InkStream a full-scale funding graph for Polkadot projects.

**Technology Stack:**
InkStream is fundamentally an **ink! 6.x smart contract project** deployed on a Substrate-based network. Key technologies and components include:

* **Smart Contracts:** We will use **Rust and ink!** for writing the core contract(s). We plan to utilize the latest ink! 6 features, including improved trait support and possibly **OpenBrush** libraries for common patterns. For example, we may use OpenBrush’s PSP22 (ERC-20 equivalent) interfaces if interacting with fungible tokens, and OpenBrush’s upgradeable proxy pattern if needed.
* **Multi-Asset Support:** Polkadot AssetHub supports multiple assets. Our contract will be asset-agnostic: it will handle DOT by default (as the native AssetHub token) and potentially other assets (e.g. USDT on AssetHub). We will leverage the chain’s *Assets* pallet through ink! if available, or treat asset transfers via XCM for cross-chain assets.
* **XCM Integration:** Using **ink! environment functions for XCM** (available since ink! 5.1), our contract will support cross-chain transfers. For example, if a Stream List recipient is an address on another parachain or the Relay Chain, we can package an XCM message to transfer the specified amount to that chain when distribution occurs. We will utilize `env().xcm_send()` to send reserve-backed transfer XCMs. Initially, we’ll support sending the Relay Chain’s native asset (DOT) to Relay Chain addresses via AssetHub’s sovereign account as a demo. In future, this can extend to parachain assets. This XCM capability is a **cutting-edge feature of ink! 6** that will highlight Polkadot’s cross-consensus strength in our application.
* **Frontend/UI:** The user interface will be a **Web dashboard** (likely a React/TypeScript single-page application). It will interact with the ink! contracts via Polkadot.js API. We will integrate Polkadot browser wallets (e.g. Polkadot.js extension, Talisman, SubWallet) for user signing. The dashboard will allow users to:

  * Connect their Polkadot account, view their Stream Lists, create or edit streams (recipients, rates, etc.).
  * Browse and search for projects/recipients by name (with identity info and GitHub links).
  * View incoming streams for their account (if they are a recipient), including analytics like total received over time.
  * Trigger manual distribution (if needed) or see countdown to next automatic distribution.
  * Use identity features (e.g. link GitHub account, register their identity).
* **Backend/Indexing:** To provide a rich user experience (analytics, notifications), we will set up an indexing service. Likely we’ll use **SubQuery** or **Subsquid** to index contract events (such as stream creation, fund deposits, distribution events) into a database. This will power features like:

  * Analytics dashboards (who are top funded projects, monthly volumes, etc.).
  * User notifications (e.g. “you received X DOT from stream Y”).
  * Historical data queries (e.g. list of all past distributions).
    All code for indexing and any off-chain service will be open source as well. We aim to keep the on-chain contract as the source of truth and only use off-chain indexing for read-heavy or historical queries, to maintain decentralization principles.
* **Upgradability:** Within ink!’s constraints, we will architect the smart contract for **upgradeability**. Specifically, we plan to implement a **proxy contract** pattern. There will be a small proxy contract deployed that holds the persistent state (all stream configurations and funds) and delegates calls to a logic contract. The proxy’s `forward_to` address can be updated by an admin (Chainscore Labs multisig or eventually governance) via a special entrypoint. This means if a critical bug is found or a new feature is to be added beyond ink! 6’s capabilities, we can deploy a new implementation and point the proxy to it without migrating user state. We will carefully follow ink!’s recommended upgradable contract approach (either the proxy-forwarding or `delegate_call` method). Of course, upgrades will be used sparingly and transparently, since immutability is still a value; but having this in place adds safety for a production system. We will document this clearly so users understand the trust model (admin key control and plans to possibly DAO-ify governance of upgrades in future).
* **Security & Testing:** We will prioritize writing comprehensive unit tests in ink! for all contract logic (covering scenarios like correct splitting, edge cases of rounding, adding/removing recipients, stopping streams, etc.). We will also perform integration testing on a local Substrate node (using `cargo contract test` and possibly running a local Rococo/AssetHub instance). Before mainnet deployment, we plan to conduct an audit (either internal or third-party, depending on budget outside the grant). Our code will be licensed under Apache-2.0 or MIT (as required) and open for community review to maximize security through transparency.

**Documentation:**
We will produce thorough documentation for each component:

* **Code Documentation:** Inline Rust docs for the contracts, explaining each function, plus a commented overview of the contract storage layout and math (for splits, etc.).
* **Technical Specification:** A markdown or docs site describing the system architecture, including diagrams of how a stream flows from sender to recipients (and across chains), how the upgradeable proxy works, and how identity integration is structured. This will help ink! developers understand our design choices.
* **User Guide/Tutorial:** We will write a tutorial (and record a demo if useful) showing a user how to use InkStream end-to-end: e.g. Alice sets up a stream of DOT to Bob and Carol, Bob claims with his Polkadot address, etc., including how to use the web dashboard and Polkadot{.js} wallet to interact with the contract.
* **API/SDK Documentation:** If we provide an SDK (very likely a TypeScript library for front-end integration), we will document its usage for developers. This could include examples of embedding InkStream functionality into other dApps (for instance, a DAO’s frontend using our SDK to create a stream).
* All docs will be stored in a `/docs` folder in the repo or a GitBook for ease of access. We aim to make the project a reference for others in the community to learn from.

**Current Status / Prior Research:**
We have **researched existing token streaming solutions** as background. Notably, we studied **drips.network’s architecture** and open-sourced contracts, as well as Ethereum’s **Sablier** and **Superfluid** protocols, to inform our design. This research gives us confidence in what features are valuable and how to implement them efficiently. As of now, the project is at the design and prototyping stage. We have drafted the data model and have begun writing a basic ink! contract outline (not yet public). No significant code has been deployed yet, but we have experimented with ink! 6.0 on a local node to verify that features like XCM calls and cross-contract calls for proxies will work as expected. We have also engaged in community discussions on the Polkadot Forum under the ink!ubator section, receiving early feedback on our approach (for example, discussing how to best handle identity verification for GitHub repos).

In summary, the concept is **well-researched and ready to implement**. Our team has prior experience building on Substrate (we have built simple ink! DApps and contributed to open-source tooling, see Team section), which we will leverage to deliver this project in a timely manner.

**Out of Scope / Limitations:**
To manage expectations, we clarify what InkStream **will not** include in this 3-month scope:

* We are **not launching a new token** as part of this project. InkStream itself will not have a native token or perform a token sale. All focus is on the software and smart contracts.
* We do not plan to implement our own on-chain governance or DAO module within this grant’s scope. Governance of the platform (upgrade keys, fee parameters) will initially be handled by the team/multisig, with a future goal to transition to community governance, but that is beyond the MVP.
* The initial version will support **fungible token streaming** only, not NFTs or other asset classes. NFT streaming or revenue-sharing could be a future idea but is not included now.
* We will not handle off-chain payment integrations (like fiat or bank payments) – the project is purely on-chain crypto streaming.
* While our business model is considered (see below), we will not focus on monetization or revenue in the MVP. No fees will be charged in the initial version beyond minimal network fees. Features like taking a percentage fee or premium services are optional future considerations.
* Security audits by third parties are highly desired but may not be fully covered by this grant budget. We will do our best with internal resources and possibly seek a follow-up security grant (via DOTPAL) or external funding for a professional audit if needed.
* Lastly, **InkStream is not a regulated financial product**. It’s a developer tool and protocol. Users must still trust the code (open-source and hopefully audited) and use it at their own risk. We will state clearly that no legal/financial guarantees are provided by the team.

**Business Model & Future Plans:**
InkStream is envisioned as a long-term **open-source infrastructure with a sustainable model**. In the short term, our focus is on user adoption rather than revenue – we want to bootstrap usage in the Polkadot ecosystem (which benefits Polkadot’s growth). That said, we have a few avenues for sustainability:

* After the grant, as usage grows, we might introduce a **protocol fee** on streams (for example, a 0.5% fee on streamed funds or a small monthly subscription for heavy users). Any such fee would be modest and likely governed by a community DAO in the future to ensure it’s fair and transparent. The fee could fund ongoing development and maintenance.
* Another model is **B2B or white-label service**: Polkadot parachains or projects could integrate our streaming functionality for their users. Chainscore Labs could offer customization or hosting of the InkStream backend for enterprise partners (for instance, helping a specific parachain’s treasury set up streaming). This service-based approach could generate revenue while keeping the core protocol open.
* We also foresee the possibility of **forming a DAO or cooperative** around InkStream if it gains community traction. A DAO could oversee upgrades and fee parameters, possibly with a governance token (though, again, no token is planned at launch to avoid distracting from utility).
* In terms of market, the target is broad: any entity needing recurring payments in Polkadot. This includes DAO treasuries, grant programs (like the Polkadot Treasury itself could use streaming for milestone-based payouts), freelancers in the ecosystem paid in crypto, and developers seeking funding for their public goods. By catering to these needs, we expect strong demand if we deliver a reliable product.

Overall, our business model emphasizes **open innovation first, monetization second**. By providing value to the ecosystem, we believe opportunities for sustainability will arise naturally (either via ecosystem funding, partnerships, or community-driven models). We will detail more of these plans under *Future Plans* below and remain flexible to adjust based on user feedback and Polkadot’s evolving landscape.

## Development Status \:open\_book:

* We have undergone an initial **research and design phase**. This included studying Drips.network’s documentation, reviewing the ink! 6 upgrades (especially XCM and upgradability features), and drafting the contract architecture and data structures on paper.
* No live deployment exists yet. However, we have set up a local development environment: a local Substrate node (Contracts pallet) for testing. We’ve successfully compiled a trivial ink! contract on ink! 6 and executed XCM calls in a test environment to ensure we know how to integrate that when the time comes.
* There are no other grants or external funding for this project yet. This is our first application specifically for InkStream.
* The grant will kick off full development. All tools and resources needed (Rust/ink!, Node environments, etc.) are ready. We plan to maintain a public “build diary” (possibly via weekly Medium or forum updates) once the grant starts, to share our progress with the community.

## Development Roadmap \:nut\_and\_bolt:

| **0b.** | **Documentation**                 | We will provide **comprehensive documentation** for the milestone deliverables: inline code comments for the contract, a **README** describing how to deploy and use the contract, and a basic **usage guide** for testing the streaming functionality. Documentation will include an overview of the contract’s design and any deviations from the initial plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **0c.** | **Testing & Testing Guide**       | We will write **unit tests** covering core contract logic (e.g., adding/removing recipients, calculating correct splits, distributing funds). We expect to cover at least 80% of the core logic with tests. A **Testing Guide** will be provided describing how to run the tests (`cargo test`) and how to set up a local node to manually test contract calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **0d.** | **Docker Environment**            | We will provide a Dockerfile or docker-compose setup that launches a local Substrate node (Contracts-enabled, e.g., Canvas or Phala node) and deploys the compiled InkStream contract for easy testing. This allows evaluators to spin up a testing environment without hassle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **1.**  | **InkStream Core Contract (MVP)** | Implementation of the core ink! smart contract that enables:<ul><li>Creation of a Stream List with multiple recipients and percentage or fixed allocations per recipient.</li><li>Function to start a stream by depositing tokens (e.g., DOT) and setting rate/interval. The contract escrow logic will hold the balance and track stream timing.</li><li>Function to stop or update a stream (e.g., change recipients or allocations) by the stream owner.</li><li>Function to trigger distribution of accumulated funds to recipients according to the configured splits. This will actually transfer the token balances to recipients’ addresses. In MVP, this can be manually called to simulate the end-of-interval payout. Automated scheduling will be handled off-chain initially (e.g., a cron job calling this function).</li><li>Basic support for identity references: recipients can be identified by AccountId. (Full GitHub integration comes in Milestone 2, but we’ll lay groundwork by including fields for “project ID” vs “user address” and allowing a simple mapping.)</li></ul>The contract will be delivered in a compiled Wasm bundle and ink! metadata file, ready to deploy on a testnet. We will also deploy it on a public testnet (e.g., Contracts on Rococo or a local Canvas testnet) and provide the address for verification. |
| **2.**  | **Basic Front-end Demo**          | A minimal web front-end (or set of Polkadot-JS scripts) demonstrating the use of the contract. For milestone 1, we will deliver one of the following (whichever is more straightforward by mid-project): <ul><li>A simple **React web page** that lets a user input stream parameters and calls the contract via polkadot.js (e.g., create a stream with recipients and deposit funds, then trigger a distribution and show the results). This will serve as a proof-of-concept UI.</li><li>**OR** a set of example scripts (using Polkadot JS API or a Rust script) showing how to interact with the contract (e.g., one script to create a stream, one to trigger distribution). This may be in lieu of a polished UI if time is tight, but will still demonstrate end-to-end functionality.</li></ul>The goal is to verify that a user can use our deliverable to stream tokens on a test network. Deliverable includes source code for the UI/scripts and instructions to use them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **3.**  | **Milestone Report**              | We will provide a document (Milestone 1 report) summarizing the work done, how to verify each deliverable, and any learnings or adjustments to scope. This will include: the contract address on testnet, instructions for running the front-end demo, and details of tests passed. The report ensures the evaluator can easily follow and validate our milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Validation:** To verify Milestone 1, evaluators can run our tests (0c), review documentation (0b), deploy the contract on a local node or provided Docker (0d) and use the demo UI/scripts (2) to create a stream. For example, one can deposit a small amount of test tokens and set two recipients with 50/50 split, then call the distribution function – the two recipients’ balances should increase accordingly by the split amount. We will also demonstrate more complex cases (multiple recipients with different percentages) in our tests and documentation to prove correctness.

| **0b.** | **Documentation**                       | We will update and expand documentation to cover all new features. This includes:<ul><li>Guide for **Identity linking** (how a GitHub user can claim a project, how on-chain identity info is displayed).</li><li>Guide for **Cross-chain streaming** (how to set a recipient on another chain, prerequisites like the asset being transferable via XCM).</li><li>Updated **User guide** for the full dApp (with screenshots of the UI, step-by-step usage).</li><li>Technical docs for any new contracts or modules (e.g., if a separate registry contract for GitHub mapping is introduced).</li></ul>We will also likely publish this as a proper documentation site or wiki for user-friendliness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **0c.** | **Testing & Guide**                     | We will add tests for new contract functionality (especially around XCM transfers and any new edge cases introduced by upgrades). For instance, a unit test simulating an XCM call (this might be abstract, possibly using a mock if direct XCM is hard to test in unit context) and tests for the GitHub claim logic (ensuring only authorized users can claim, etc.). We will provide an updated Testing Guide explaining how to test cross-chain transfers – possibly using a local multi-chain setup (e.g., one could spin up two nodes and use our Docker setup to simulate an XCM). If such integration testing is complex, we will manually test on a testnet and include logs/screenshots as proof in the documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **0d.** | **Docker & Deployment**                 | We will extend the Docker environment to include **Polkadot AssetHub** if available (or a similar environment) for testing cross-chain features. Additionally, we will provide a Docker setup for the frontend (if applicable) so that one can run the entire stack (contract + UI). If possible, we’ll include a script to deploy the contract to a local node for convenience. This deliverable ensures that by end of Milestone 2, anyone can spin up a full InkStream test instance in a container.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **0e.** | **Article/Tutorial**                    | We will publish a **Medium article or tutorial blog post** describing InkStream, what was achieved in the grant, and how to use it. The content will be targeted at the Polkadot community, explaining the problem of token streaming and how our solution works, with examples. This article will also serve to **promote ink!** by highlighting how we built the project with ink! and the advantages we found (e.g., XCM integration). The article link will be provided in the delivery, and we’ll also consider doing a short video demo or community call presentation if appropriate (not mandatory, but for extra impact).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **1.**  | **Advanced Smart Contract Features**    | Finalization of the smart contract with all extended capabilities:<ul><li>**GitHub/Identity Integration:** Implement the claim mechanism for GitHub repos. This may involve a **separate contract or contract module** that stores mappings of repo identifiers to Polkadot AccountIds. We will deliver this and integrate it with the main streaming contract. We will also leverage the Polkadot Identity pallet: e.g., the contract or off-chain code will fetch on-chain identity info to display names. (The contract might not directly call the identity pallet, but our UI will handle resolution via RPC).</li><li>**Cross-Chain Fund Routing:** Enable the contract to send assets via XCM. Specifically, implement functionality so that if a recipient address is on another chain, the contract’s `distribute` function will initiate an XCM transfer of the asset. We will likely use AssetHub’s capabilities for reserve transfers of DOT to the Relay Chain (as a primary example). We will have this working on a test network (for example, Westend AssetHub to Westend relay, or similar setup) and include a demonstration. If full automation is tricky, we will document how the contract can be extended or configured for various XCM transfers, and ensure at least one concrete scenario is working in our tests (e.g., streaming to a Relay Chain account).</li><li>**Upgradeability Mechanism:** If not implemented in M1, by M2 we will refactor the contract into a proxy + logic contract structure. We will deploy the proxy and at least one logic upgrade during testing to demonstrate that an upgrade can occur (e.g., deploying v1, then a v2 with a minor change, and showing state is preserved). The deliverable is the code for proxy and an example upgrade. (We may not need to use this in production during the grant, but showing it works completes our commitment to upgradability.)</li><li>**Polish & Optimization:** We will optimize the contract for gas/weight where possible (using substrate benchmarking tools if applicable to ensure our weight estimates are accurate). Also, we’ll add any missing features discovered in M1 testing (for example, maybe a feature to withdraw remaining funds if a stream is cancelled mid-way, etc.). By end of M2, the contract should be feature-complete and ready for mainnet deployment.</li></ul>We will provide the updated Wasm and metadata. |
| **2.**  | **Full Front-End Application**          | We will deliver the **complete InkStream web application**. This includes:<ul><li>A polished **React/TypeScript** UI with pages for creating streams, listing one’s active streams, exploring public projects to fund, etc. It will connect to the contract via Polkadot.js or a lightweight API server if needed for complex calls.</li><li>**Wallet integration:** Users can connect with Polkadot wallet extensions. All transactions (creating a stream, claiming a project, etc.) can be signed through the UI seamlessly.</li><li>**Display of Identity:** The UI will display known identity info for addresses (e.g., if an address has a name set in Polkadot identity, show it; if a GitHub repo is claimed, show the repo name and link).</li><li>**Analytics Dashboard:** A section of the UI will show aggregated data (this will be powered by our indexer). For instance, top 10 funded projects, total volume streamed in last month, etc., to highlight usage. This also serves to encourage ecosystem participation by showing impact.</li><li>We will ensure the UI is responsive and tested on modern browsers. We will provide the full source code and also host a live demo on a testnet (e.g., we might deploy the UI on a public URL pointing to a testnet instance so the committee can easily try it out with a test wallet).</li></ul>Successful completion means a user with minimal technical knowledge could use InkStream through this web app without interacting with raw contracts. This front-end will greatly increase the accessibility and thus the impact of our project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **3.**  | **SDK / API**                           | We will provide a **developer SDK** (likely as an NPM package) or at least a well-documented API interface for InkStream. This could be a TypeScript library that wraps common contract calls (e.g., `createStream(list)` function that under the hood calls the contract’s extrinsic, or a `getStreams(address)` that queries our indexer for streams involving that address). The goal is to make it easy for other developers to integrate InkStream into their dApps or automation scripts. Deliverable will include the library code, usage examples, and publishing to NPM (if time permits) or instructions to include it directly. If a TS SDK is too heavy, as an alternative we will produce a detailed **API documentation** of the contract’s ABI (so any developer can call the contract using Polkadot API given our metadata). However, our preference is to offer a simple SDK for convenience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **4.**  | **Deployment and AssetHub Integration** | By end of M2, we will deploy InkStream on a *live network*. Ideally, this would be **Polkadot AssetHub** (if contracts are live on AssetHub by that time – current roadmap suggests by end of 2024 AssetHub on Polkadot will support contracts). If AssetHub is available, we will deploy our contract there and perhaps do a small public beta with real DOT on test scale. If AssetHub is not yet ready, we will use an alternative like **Contracts on Rococo** or a contract-enabled parachain to demonstrate functionality with real cross-chain transfers. This deliverable ensures that our solution is not just theoretical: it’s operational in the intended Polkadot environment. We will document the deployment process and any configuration needed. Integration with wallets (e.g., Talisman, Subwallet) will be verified – we will make sure our metadata is compatible and possibly register the contract ABI with common frontends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **5.**  | **Grant Report and Future Plan**        | We will produce a **final report** that will be submitted with the milestone, summarizing the entire project, reflecting on goals achieved vs initial plan, and outlining next steps (post-grant plans). In this report (and in the “Future Plans” section below) we will detail how we intend to maintain and grow InkStream. This will include our business/governance model, community engagement strategy (like forming a user community, getting projects onboarded), and any plans to seek additional funding or partnerships. Essentially, we will make a strong case that InkStream will continue to thrive beyond this prototype, maximizing the impact of the grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Validation:** For Milestone 2, the evaluator will be able to **fully use InkStream as an end-user** and see the advanced features in action. For instance:

* The evaluator can go to our hosted front-end, connect a Polkadot testnet wallet, and create a stream of testnet DOT to two accounts on different chains (one on the same chain, one on a different parachain or relay chain). They can then watch as, upon triggering distribution, the on-chain events show one transfer locally and one XCM transfer remotely (we will provide instructions to verify balances on the other chain).
* The evaluator can test the GitHub claim process: we will provide a dummy GitHub repo and account for demonstration with a known proof, so they can simulate claiming and see that the contract now recognizes that repo’s maintainers.
* All the mandatory deliverables (docs, tests, article) will be available for review to ensure completeness.
  We will consider Milestone 2 successful when the protocol is essentially launch-ready: anyone could deploy our code on Polkadot and have a working Drips-like streaming service.

## Future Plans

After completing the Inkubator grant, Chainscore Labs plans to **push InkStream toward production and ecosystem adoption**. Our vision is for InkStream to become a **self-sustaining platform** widely used across Polkadot and Kusama. Key future plans include:

* **Launch on Mainnet:** We intend to deploy InkStream on **Polkadot AssetHub** (for DOT streaming) and possibly on **Kusama AssetHub** (for KSM and experimentation) shortly after the grant. We will do thorough testing and likely an audit (if not done during the grant) before handling real funds. A phased launch might occur – starting with a **beta** on Kusama to gather real user feedback under lower stakes, then a full launch on Polkadot.

* **Community Engagement and Growth:** We will actively reach out to Polkadot teams and communities to adopt InkStream. For example, we’ll approach known ecosystem projects (wallet providers, DAOs, treasury committees) to integrate or trial our streaming. We plan to present InkStream in a Polkadot community call or at an event (such as a Polkadot Decoded session) to showcase its capabilities. Another idea is organizing a **campaign or hackathon**: e.g., sponsor a challenge for building cool extensions on InkStream (maybe funded by our team or a follow-up grant) to spur usage and feedback.

* **Governance & Decentralization:** Long term, we aim to decentralize InkStream’s governance. One possibility is to establish a **InkStream Council/DAO** made of representatives from major stakeholders (similar to how Uniswap or others have governance). This body could manage updates and parameter changes. If appropriate, we might introduce a governance token to facilitate this (again, separate from core functionality; purely for governance if ever launched). We will carefully evaluate regulatory considerations and may seek advice from Parity/W3F on best practices here.

* **Sustainability & Business Model:** As outlined, we will gradually introduce a sustainable funding model. For example, after gaining a user base, a tiny fee on each stream could be enabled (through a contract upgrade via governance). The collected fees could fund a treasury used for maintenance, grants to projects building on InkStream, or buy-back-and-burn if a token model is present. We will also explore **enterprise partnerships** – for instance, helping a major organization use InkStream for payroll could come with a support contract for Chainscore Labs.

* **Feature Roadmap:** We have many ideas beyond the initial scope:

  * **Stream NFTs or SBTs:** Represent ongoing streams as NFTs or Soulbound Tokens that could be transferable or used as proof-of-funding.
  * **Insurance / Safeguards:** Implement fail-safes like the ability for a sender to set a maximum cap or a time limit on a stream to avoid runaway conditions. Or allow a trusted third-party module that can pause streams in emergencies (with user consent) – useful for security.
  * **Multi-currency and DeFi Integration:** Extend to more assets beyond DOT/KSM – e.g., integrate with Acala’s aUSD or other stablecoins so users can stream stable payments. Also possibly integrate with yield protocols: e.g., funds in a stream could earn yield in parallel (some DeFi strategies) and then distribute both principal and yield to recipients.
  * **Cross-ecosystem Bridging:** In the far future, consider linking with Ethereum or other chains. For example, an Ethereum user might want to stream ETH to a Polkadot address – this could be done via a bridge and a mirrored InkStream contract on Ethereum. This is beyond Polkadot-centric scope, but it shows the extensibility of our concept.

* **Maintenance:** Chainscore Labs is dedicated to maintaining InkStream for the foreseeable future. We will keep the codebase updated with new ink! versions and Substrate changes. We will promptly fix bugs and respond to GitHub issues. The documentation will be maintained as features evolve. After the grant, we intend to apply for **Ink!ubator follow-up support or a Web3 Foundation grant** if needed for specific enhancements (for example, funding a security audit or building a particular new feature). We will also encourage external contributions by making the project welcoming on GitHub (good first issues, developer guides).

In summary, our future plan is to transition InkStream from a grant-funded prototype to a **fully-fledged, community-driven project** that delivers ongoing value to Polkadot/Web3. By emphasizing innovation, openness, and utility, we believe InkStream can become a key piece of Web3 infrastructure, driving more activity and loyalty to the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Additional Information \:heavy\_plus\_sign:

* **How did you hear about the program?** We learned about the ink!ubator 2.0 program and this specific RFP via the **Polkadot Open Source Developer Grants Program** group chat on Element. The ink!ubator RFP document highlighting a “token streaming mechanism (like drips.network)” caught our attention immediately, as it aligns with our interests and expertise.
* **RFP Alignment:** This proposal is specifically crafted in response to that RFP call. We have tailored our solution to meet and exceed the RFP requirements by adding Polkadot-specific enhancements (cross-chain support, on-chain identity integration).
* **Prior Work:** As a team, we have not received prior grants for this project. However, individual team members have contributed to related open-source efforts (for example, one member contributed to **ink! Playground** development last year, and another to a **SubQuery indexing project**). These experiences indirectly support our current work (e.g., familiarity with SubQuery for analytics).
* **Other Contributions:** No other team or entity has financially contributed to InkStream yet. It’s an original effort by Chainscore Labs in response to the RFP. We have, however, benefited from the open-source knowledge of projects like Drips and Sablier as inspiration.
* **Commitment:** We understand that a condition of this program is regular updates on the Polkadot Forum. We are fully committed to transparent communication. We will post progress updates at least bi-weekly and be responsive to any feedback from the community or grant evaluators. We will also deploy an example contract to AssetHub’s testnet and write a **tutorial Medium post** on how to use it (per the guidelines) once we reach that stage, and a final post summarizing outcomes at the end of the grant.
* **Why ink!/Polkadot:** We want to highlight that we chose ink! for this project because we truly believe in the **technical advantages** of the Polkadot environment for such a use case. The ability to write in Rust, use Wasm, and have built-in multi-chain messaging is a game-changer for building a sophisticated dApp like InkStream. Part of our application’s goal is to **showcase these advantages** to the broader community, perhaps even attracting some Ethereum developers to consider ink! by demonstrating what is possible.

We are excited about the potential of InkStream to become a cornerstone of on-chain finance in Polkadot. Thank you for considering our proposal. We are open to feedback and eager to make this a success for the ink! ecosystem!
